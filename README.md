Data sorting visualizer using a python generator and pygame for visualization.
Keybinds are shown on screen, as well as some statistics about each sorting algorithm.
Don't expect this to be completely accurate, as my code is not very good, and python is slow.

WIP:
- Add easier adjustments of everything
  - easier management of data
  - easier adjusting visuals
      - Switching between scatter plot and bar graph
- Adding more sorting algorithms

Details:
