Data sorting visualizer using a python generator and pygame for visualization.
Keybinds are shown on screen, as well as some statistics about each sorting algorithm.
Don't expect this to be completely accurate, as my code is not very good, and python is slow.

WIP:
- Add easier adjustments of everything
  - easier management of data
  - easier adjusting visuals
      - Switching between scatter plot and bar graph
- Adding more sorting algorithms

Details:
- How to clone:
  - In visual studio code:
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af916bc2-7037-48ff-80fc-64f614ec0731)
    - Click clone git repository and enter `pyricRL/Data-Sorting-Visualized`
    - From there, select your file location and click clone
    - Wait for it to finish and once the below image pops up, click open

    - Once the files open, go to `main.py` and hit the run button in the top right corner
    - This will then open the program and allow you to run it and view the sorting algorithms
  - Other IDE/Command Prompt:
    - Open command prompt and type `cd mydrive:/mydirectory/folder/...` to enter the folder you would like to clone the project into
        - For more information on how to do this, go here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/change-directories-in-command-prompt/
    - Within that folder, type `mkdir yourfilename`
    - cd into that folder by using `cd yourfilename`
    - From that folder you should now be able to use the command `git clone https://github.com/PyricRL/Data-Sorting-Visualized.git`
    - Open that folder in your IDE of choice and now you can run it from there
